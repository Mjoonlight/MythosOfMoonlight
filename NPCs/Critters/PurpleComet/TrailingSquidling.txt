- Uses the semi-circle trailing system, except each time, it does a full circle
- The squidling can accelerate and decelerate, and each time a full cicle is done, it will
branch to another circle from the starting position, with a randomly sized circuit; its speed
is inversely relative to the size of the circle
- The squidling may randomly stop for a few seconds, then spontaneously boost at a constant high
speed; this will leave a trail of dust and ink for a few seconds; the same event can happen
